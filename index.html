<H2>Is it a good idea for people to have different brands as companies do?</h2>
<p>I believe people should have different brands. Get all the advantages companies get by having different brands for different segments of customer. This brand of mine aims to be bold, artistic and expressive. I'll have a different brand to be logical and scrupulous.</p>
